TwoSum
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    You can return the answer in any order.
    
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
    
    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
    Output: [1,2]

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
    Output: [0,1]


PlusOne
    You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.

    Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

    Example 1:
    Input: digits = [1,2,3]
    Output: [1,2,4]
    Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
    Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
    Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

    Example 2:
    Input: digits = [4,3,2,1]
    Output: [4,3,2,2]
    Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
    Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
    Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

    Example 3:
    Input: digits = [9]
    Output: [1,0]
    Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
    Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
    Thus, the result should be [1,0].


CombinationSum
    Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

    The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the  frequency
    Frequency
    The frequency of an element x is the number of times it occurs in the array.

    of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

    The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

 

    Example 1:
    Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
    Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
    Explanation:
    2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
    7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
    These are the only two combinations.

    Example 2:
    Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
    Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]

    Example 3:
    Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
    Output: []
